\title{
SMSC estimates the parameters of the mixture of binomial using the non parametric approach.
}
\description{
we propose statistical methods for single cell MethylC-Seq and RRBS data that
simultaneously take into account the spatial correlation between DNA methylation profiles at
neighbouring CpG sites and correct for the experimental and sequencing errors. Following Cheng
& Zhu (2014), we model the observed count of C reads in the presence of sequencing errors with
a mixture of binomial distributions. In our case, we consider a methylation probability that
varies with the genomic location and derive a smoothed kernel-based EM-algorithm to estimate
the parameters of our model.
}
\usage{
SMSC(C, CT, t, p1 = 0.85, p2 = 0.1, method = c("Locfit", "KNN1", "KNN2", "MSC"), eps = 1e-06, K = 70, h = 1000, maxIt = 100)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{

}
  \item{p1}{

  \item{method}{
   a character string specifying the ckeck the non parametric method to use for smoothing the probability that site i is methylated, valid options are:
		\itemize{
		\item \code{"Locfit"}: we use the .
                \item \code{"KNN1"}: we use the .
                \item \code{"KNN2"}: we use the .
		\item \code{"MSC"}: the probability in the site i is the average of all sites (procedure MSC: Cheng et al 2014),
		} Default is \code{"Locfit"}
